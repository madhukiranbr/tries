Why CNCF? 

  

1. Better resource efficiency lets you to run the same number of services on less servers 

2. Improved resiliency and availability: despite failures of individual applications, and even data centers 

3. Cloud native allows multi-cloud (switching between public clouds or running on multiple ones) and hybrid cloud (moving workloads between your data center and the public cloud) 

4. Cloud native infrastructure enables higher development velocity – improving your services faster – with lower risk 

5. Interactive landscape to group sandbox, incubating and graduated projects directly correlating with stability of a product. 

6. Certification, trainings and partnerships for organization of all levels of adoption by vetted service providers
